# state-wise-disease-oubreak-for-india

Disease Outbreak Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict potential disease outbreaks using machine learning models and historical health data. By analyzing patterns in epidemiological data, environmental factors, and demographic information, the system provides early warnings to support public health decision-making.
Features

Data Processing: Cleans and preprocesses datasets for model training.
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms to predict disease outbreak risks.
Visualization: Generates charts and maps to visualize outbreak trends.
Real-Time Monitoring: Integrates with external data sources for up-to-date predictions (if applicable).

Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ (or specify your language/environment)
pip (for Python package management)
Git (for version control)

Steps

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-outbreak-prediction.git
cd disease-outbreak-prediction


Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Prepare Data:

Place your dataset in the data/ directory (e.g., CSV files with epidemiological data).
Update config.yaml with dataset paths and parameters.


Run the Pipeline:
python main.py

This script preprocesses data, trains the model, and generates predictions.

View Results:

Predictions are saved in outputs/predictions/.
Visualizations (e.g., graphs, heatmaps) are saved in outputs/visualizations/.


Dependencies
Listed in requirements.txt. Key libraries include:

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy

Install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Data

Source: (Specify your data source, e.g., WHO, CDC, or synthetic data)
Format: CSV files with columns for date, location, cases, deaths, etc.
Preprocessing: Handled by src/preprocessing.py (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing features).
